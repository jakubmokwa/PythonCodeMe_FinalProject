# Python CODE:ME Final Project
Sorting Algorithms
Project is a summation of knowledge acquired during 'CODE:ME Python od - kurs zdalny' course.
Project is a collection of sorting algorithms and comparison of their average sorting times in main.py file.
Each algorithm is written in a separate file and so can be imported as a module in other projects.
Every algorithm was tested using Python unitest module, with data stored in tests_data.py.
